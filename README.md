# JS-30-days-challenge
A 30 days challenge based on JavaScript 30 course.

## About this challenge:
JavaScript 30 is Vanilla JS course created by [Wes BOS](https://wesbos.com), which contains 30 projects. Those projects are meant to increase our front-end programming skills in fun way.

I recommend them for everyone, who has at least some knowledge in JavaScript and wants to take it further!
